    <h5>SEAGrid Portal Vs GridChem Desktop Client</h5>

    <p> SEAGrid Gateway has evolved from initial focus in Chemistry (GridChem) encompassing broader Science and
        Engineering Applications. In addition to the desktop client, SEAGrid provides a Web Browser based gateway access.
        The SEAGrid gateway is in active development and we welcome you to try the pre-production alpha release and provide feedback.


    <p> Note: For production usage, we recommend using the GridChem Desktop client.</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li> The new Java security may require you to add the new deployment site https://gridchem.uits.iu.edu to allowed sites through java security configuration for now. If you save the GridChem Java Web Start file (gridchem*.jnlp) to your local machine, you may have to update the file at the next new update( Watch Notices on www.seagrid.org /Announcements on the GridChem client). You can launch GridChem client by clicking on the link above. This will ensure that you always get the most recent Java Web Start file.</li>
			<li> This version of GridChem client requires <a href="">Java1.5</a></li>
			<li> There is an identified problem with downloading large files, greater than 1MB in size.  When this occurs, the file will begin to download (the green progress bar will move) but after about 5 minutes an error will be recieved saying that the server could not be accessed or that the files could not be updated. If this occurs, please send an e-mail to help@seagrid.org with your job id and a GridChem staff member will fetch the file for you.</li>
			<li> Currently multiple "Sesssion Timeout" panels can popup and not be closed unless the application is killed in taskmanager. Staff are working to resolve this issue. </li>
